## Contents

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that were used to conduct data analysis and develop data visualizations. These notebooks are linked to below. Each notebook used a Python 3.10 kernel with packages as listed in the [pygplates_py310.yml](code/pygplates_py310.yml) file. The code in the paleogeography notebooks also relies on [pygplates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/) which is imported from a local user specified path (`pygplates_0.36.0_py39_Darwin-x86_64` was used for the execution of the notebooks whose output is preserved here).
